# BizmatesExam

# Thank you for this oppurtunity. I learned and enjoyed working with the given exam. I am not good with web designing and being creative that's why i focus on back-end in my development career so for this exam I created a simple UI that comply with the requirements such as informing the Users of the venue available within that City and displaying the weather condition of that city on that day when the Get Information Button is clicked.
